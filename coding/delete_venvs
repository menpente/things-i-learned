Deleting an existing virtual environment (venv) is straightforward. Here are the steps:

1. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:
   If the virtual environment is currently active, deactivate it first:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

2. **Remove the Virtual Environment Directory**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     rm -rf path_to_your_venv
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     rmdir /s /q path_to_your_venv
     ```

Replace `path_to_your_venv` with the actual path to your virtual environment directory.

This will completely remove the virtual environment from your system.
