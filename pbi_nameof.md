In Power BI, the `NAMEOF` function is used in DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to return the fully qualified name of a column or measure as a string. This function is particularly useful for maintaining the integrity of your model when changes are made to column names.

### Key Features of `NAMEOF` in Power BI:

1. **Dynamic Column Names**: If you rename a column, any DAX formula using `NAMEOF` will automatically update to reflect the new name. This ensures that your model remains stable even after changes[1][2].

2. **Fully Qualified Names**: `NAMEOF` returns the fully qualified name of a column, which includes the table name followed by the column name, e.g., `'Table'[Column]`[4][5].

3. **Use in Field Parameters**: In Power BI, `NAMEOF` is often used in field parameters to dynamically reference columns. This allows for flexible filtering and analysis without having to manually update formulas when column names change[1][5].

### Example Usage:

```dax
ColumnName = NAMEOF('Table'[Column])
```

This would return the string `'Table'[Column]`, which is the fully qualified name of the column.

### Benefits:

- **Flexibility**: Allows for easy renaming of columns without breaking formulas.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies model maintenance by automatically updating references when column names change.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Facilitates dynamic filtering and analysis by ensuring that formulas always reference the correct columns, even after changes.
