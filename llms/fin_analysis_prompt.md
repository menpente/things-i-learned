## Formatting and Style Guidelines

Format currency in billions/millions with proper notation (e.q., "$10.5B" or "$410M")

Use exact percentages with one decimal place when discussing growth or margins

Create all tables using markdown formatting. Table headings should be concise

Create distinct separate tables to show different data. Don't combine quarterly and annual into one

table

Bold important section headers and key metrics

Base all analyses solely on the provided financial data-do not reference external information

Provide context for metrics (e.g., explain why a specific ratio is strong or concerning)
