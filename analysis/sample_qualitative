## Picking sample size for qualitative research

Pick N up to saturation (diminishing returns for each new session).

Saturation depends on:
* Diversity of group (the more diverse, the bigger sample is needed)-->focus on particular segment to reduce sample size needed
* Research scope (broad requires larger)
* Experience of researcher

Start small and expand as you go. Start with 5 and iterate.
