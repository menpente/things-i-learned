To conduct exploratory analysis on your MongoDB data using Studio 3T, follow these structured steps:

## 1. **Connect to Your MongoDB Database**
   - Launch Studio 3T and connect to your MongoDB instance where you imported the JSON files.

## 2. **View Collections**
   - Navigate to the **Collection Tab**. This is your starting point for exploring data. You can view the contents of your collections here, which will display the documents in a grid format[4].

## 3. **Analyze Schema**
   - Use the **Schema Explorer** feature to analyze the structure of your collections:
     - Right-click on the collection name in the Connection Tree and select **Analyze Schema**.
     - Configure the analysis by setting options like document sample size (e.g., 1000 documents) and query criteria if needed[1].
     - Click on **Run Analysis** to generate insights into field distributions, missing fields, and incorrect field types.

## 4. **Explore Data Distributions**
   - After running the schema analysis, examine:
     - **Schema Tree**: Displays all discovered fields and their types.
     - **Charts Tab**: Shows visualizations such as histograms for numeric fields and top values for categorical fields[1].
   - This helps identify patterns, outliers, and missing data.

## 5. **Visual Query Builder**
   - Use the **Visual Query Builder** to create queries without writing code. This tool allows you to filter, sort, and project specific fields from your data[4].
   - You can also use the **Main Query Bar** to run custom queries directly in JSON format.

## 6. **Statistics Overview**
   - Right-click on your collection and select **Collection Statistics** to view overall stats like document count and size. This provides a quick overview of your dataset[4].

## 7. **Documentation Generation**
   - After completing your analysis, you can export the results by clicking on the **Generate Documentation** button, allowing you to save insights in formats like Word or CSV for future reference[1].

## 8. **Further Analysis with Aggregation Framework**
   - For more complex analyses, utilize MongoDBâ€™s aggregation framework available in Studio 3T:
     - Create aggregation pipelines using stages like `$group`, `$match`, and `$lookup` to manipulate and analyze your data further[5].

By following these steps, you'll be able to effectively conduct exploratory analysis on your MongoDB collections using Studio 3T, uncovering valuable insights from your imported data.
